Scan2Chat

Scan2Chat is an amazing web app I created while exploring different libraries with React.js. Using the qrcode.react library, Scan2Chat generates QR codes for specific WhatsApp numbers, making it easier than ever to connect with others without the hassle of manually entering phone numbers.

For those who frequently share their WhatsApp contact information—such as business professionals, event organizers, or social enthusiasts—Scan2Chat can be a real convenience. Simply input your WhatsApp number, and the app instantly creates a QR code that you can download and share. This QR code allows others to connect with you on WhatsApp just by scanning it, eliminating the need to type in the number manually.

Scan2Chat not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors when entering contact details. Whether you're networking at an event, distributing contact information in a marketing campaign, or simply sharing your WhatsApp with friends, Scan2Chat provides a seamless, user-friendly experience. It's amazing what a bit of curiosity and some code can create!
